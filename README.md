# ssh-tunnel
This repo provides scripts to set up an ssh-tunnel ([local port forwarding](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling/example)) using either
- [openssh](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) (with classical cryptohraphy) or
- [open-quantum-safe/openssh](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) (with post-quantum cryptography)

It is the result of a feasability study and therefore meant for demo/prototyping purposes only.

# Start
To start a ssh-tunnel using classical cryptography, head over to the [classic](/classic) directory.\
To start a ssh-tunnel using post-quantum cryptography, head over to the [pq](/pq) directory.
