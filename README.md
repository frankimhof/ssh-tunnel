# ssh-tunnel
This repo provides scripts to set up an ssh-tunnel ([local port forwarding](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling/example)) using either classical or post-quantum cryptograhpy. It is the result of a feasability study and therefore meant for demo/prototyping purposes only.

To start a ssh-tunnel using classical cryptography, head over to the [classic](/classic) directory.\
To start a ssh-tunnel using post-quantum cryptography, head over to the [pq](/pq) directory.
